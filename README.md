# Sign Language Recognition System

This project involves the development of a Sign Language Recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system is designed to understand and interpret sign language gestures made by individuals, with applications in various fields including accessibility technology, robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.

## Project Duration

- **Start Date**: January 2023
- **End Date**: March 2023

## Domain

- **MACHINE LEARNING**

## Project Description

The Sign Language Recognition system is an innovative project aimed at enabling effective communication for individuals with hearing impairments. By recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures, the system can bridge the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: The system captures and processes sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam or camera.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leverages machine learning models to accurately classify and interpret different sign language gestures.
- **Wide Application**: Besides accessibility, the system has potential applications in robotics, virtual reality, and other human-computer interaction domains, facilitating natural communication between humans and machines.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow
